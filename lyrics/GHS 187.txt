Verse 1:
Jesus, All-Atoning Lamb,
Thine, And Only Thine, I Am;
Take My Body, Spirit, Soul;
Only Thou Possess The Whole.

Thou My One Thing Needful Be;
Let Me Ever Cleave To Thee;
Let Me Choose The Better Part;
Let Me Give Thee All My Heart.

Verse 3:
Fairer Than The Sons Of Men,
Do Not Let Me Turn Again,
Leave The Fountain-Head Of Bliss,
Stoop To Creature-Happiness.

Verse 4:
Whom Have I On Earth Below?
Thee, And Only Thee, I Know;
Whom Have I In Heaven But Thee?
Thou Art All In All To Me.

Verse 5:
All My Treasure Is Above,
All My Riches Is Thy Love:
Who The Worth Of Love Can Tell?
Infinite, Unsearchable!
