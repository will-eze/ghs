Verse 1:
Resting in His love at His blessed feet,
All my heart goes forth in joyous song;
Trusting Him for pow’r every day and hour,
By His grace divine He makes me strong.

Chorus:
Resting in His love that ransomed me,
Trusting in His grace so full and free,
I shall see my Lord some day,
Where His glory shines for aye,
Resting in His love forevermore!

Verse 2:
Resting in His love by the waters still,
Sweet communion with my Lord I hold;
E’en the darkest way brighter grows each day,
As new visions of His might unfold. 

Verse 3:
Resting in His love, kept in perfect peace,
Till the home of homes with joy I see;
Where the angels sing praises to their King,
In the light of God eternally.
