Verse 1:
Lift up your heads, pilgrims a-weary,
See day’s approach now crimson the sky;
Night shadows flee, and your Beloved,
Awaited with longing, at last draweth nigh.

Chorus:
He is coming again, He is coming again,
The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is coming again,
With pow’r and great glory, He is coming again!

Verse 2:
Dark was the night, sin warred against us;
Heavy the load of sorrow we bore;
But now we see signs of His coming;
Our hearts glow within us, joy’s cup runneth o’er! 

Verse 3:
O blessed hope! O blissful promise!
Filling our hearts with rapture divine;
O day of days! hail Thy appearing!
Thy transcendent glory forever shall shine! 

Verse 4:
Even so come, precious Lord Jesus;
Creation waits redemption to see;
Caught up in clouds, soon we shall meet Thee;
O blessed assurance, forever with Thee!
