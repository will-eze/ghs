Verse 1:
Faith of our fathers living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Wheneâ€™er we hear that glorious word.

Chorus:
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to Thee till death.

Verse 2:
Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto Thee,
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall then be truly free.

Verse 3:
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
