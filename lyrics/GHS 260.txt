Verse 1:
Gracious Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would gracious be,
And with words that help and heal
Would Thy life in mine reveal;
And with actions bold and meek
Would for Christ my Savior speak.

Verse 2:
Truthful Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would truthful be;
And with wisdom kind and clear
Let Thy life in mine appear;
And with actions brotherly
Speak my Lord’s sincerity.

Verse 3:
Tender Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would tender be;
Shut my heart up like a flower,
In temptation’s darksome hour;
Open it when shines the sun,
And his love by fragrance own.

Verse 4:
Mighty Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would mighty be;
Mighty so as to prevail
Where unaided man must fail;
Ever by a mighty hope,
Pressing on and bearing up.

Verse 5:
Holy Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would holy be;
Separate from sin, I would
Choose and cherish all things good;
And whatever I can be
Give to Him who gave me Thee!

Verse 6:
Silent Spirit, dwell with me—
I myself would quiet be,
Quiet as the growing blade
Which through earth its way has made;
Silently, like morning light,
Putting mists and chills to flight.
