Verse 1:
There’s a great day coming,
A great day coming,
There’s a great day coming by and by,
When the saints and the sinners shall
be parted right and left,
Are you ready for that day to come?

Chorus:
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment day?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
for the judgment day?

Verse 2:
There’s a bright day coming,
A bright day coming,
There’s a bright day coming by and by,
But its brightness shall only come
to them that love the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to come? 

Verse 3:
There’s a sad day coming,
A sad day coming,
There’s a sad day coming by and by,
When the sinner shall hear His doom,
“Depart, I know ye not!”
Are you ready for that day to come?
