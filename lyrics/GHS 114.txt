Verse 1:
Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do,
Do not wait to shed your light afar;
To the many duties ever near you now be true,
Brighten the corner where you are.

Chorus:
Brighten the corner where you are!
Brighten the corner where you are!
Someone far from harbour you may guide across the bar,
Brighten the corner where you are.

Verse 2:
Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear,
Let not narrow self your way debar;
Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer,
Brighten the corner where you are.

Verse 3:
Here for all your talent you will surely find a need,
Here reflect the Bright and Morning star;
Even from your humble hand the bread of life may feed,
Brighten the corner where you are.
