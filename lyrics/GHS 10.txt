Verse 1:
O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer’s praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!

Verse 2:
My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro’ all the earth abroad
the honors of your name.

Verse 3:
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease,
’tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’tis life and health and peace.

Verse 4:
He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
he sets the prisoner free;
his blood can make the foulest clean;
his blood availed for me.

Verse 5:
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
your loosed tongues employ;
ye bling, behold your saviour come,
and leap, ye lam, for joy
