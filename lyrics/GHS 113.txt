Verse 1:
Go and tell the story to thy friends to-day,
How the Lord of glory met thee on thy way;
How He cleansed thy spirit from the stain of sin,
Driving out the foe who reigned thy heart within.

Chorus:
Go and tell the story, tell it fer and wide,
How the Lord of glory for the sinner died;
And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.

Verse 2:
Go and tell the story, of His pow’r to save,
Of the sinful “Legion” sunk beneath the wave;
Tell of His compassion, of His love so true,
Of the wondrous things the Lord hath done for you. 

Verse 3:
Go and tell the story, how He reigns above,
Winning men to glory thro’ His dying love;
How He waits to crown them kings forevermore,
In the home awaiting, on the other shore.
