Verse 1:
When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There’ll be somebody waiting to show me the way
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone

I won’t have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He’ll be waiting for me
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone

Verse 2:
Often times I’m weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flown
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone

Verse 3:
Tho’ the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Savior will care for his own
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep
And I won’t have to cross Jordan alone
