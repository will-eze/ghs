Verse 1:
Out in the darkness of sorrow and sin,
Somebody needs your love;
Led by the Master, that soul you may win,

Somebody needs your love.
Somebody needs your love,
Somebody needs your love,â€¦
Someone in sadness,
Yearning for gladness,
Somebody needs your love.

Verse 2:
Many are helpless, and wait for your call,
Somebody needs your love;
Show them that Jesus is all and in all,
Somebody needs your love.

Verse 3:
Some one is tempted to turn from the right,
Somebody needs your love;
Longing for courage and strength for the fight,
Somebody needs your love.

Verse 4:
Some are down-hearted, in sorrow they roam,
Somebody needs your love;
Many are sighing for heaven and home,
Somebody needs your love.
