Verse 1:
Face to face with Christ, my Saviour,
Face to face – what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me.

Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!

Verse 2:
Only faintly now, I see Him,
With the darkling veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

Verse 3:
What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.

Verse 4:
Face to face! O blissful moment!
Face to face – to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so.
