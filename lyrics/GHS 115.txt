Verse 1:
How to reach the masses, men of every birth,
For an answer Jesus gave the key:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me.”

Chorus:
Lift Him up…Lift Him up …
Still He speaks from eternity:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me.”

Verse 2:
Oh! The world is hungry for the living bread,
Lift the Saviour up for them to see;
Trust Him, and do not doubt the words that He said,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me.”

Verse 3:
Don’t exalt the preacher, don’t exalt the pew,
Preach the Gospel simple, full and free;
Prove Him and you will find that promise is true,
“I’ll draw all men unto me.”

Verse 4:
Lift Him up by living as a Christian ought,
Let the world in you the Saviour see;
Then men will gladly follow Him who once taught,
“I’ll draw all men unto me.”
