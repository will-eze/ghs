Verse 1:
Thy Word is a lamp to my feet;
A light to my path always;
To guide and to save me from sin,
And show me the heavenly way.

Chorus:
Thy Word have I hid in my heart…
That I might not sin against thee…
That I might not sin, that I might not sin,
Thy Word have I hid in my heart.

Verse 2:
For ever o Lord is Thy Word
Established and fixed on high;
Thy faithfulness to all men
Abideth for ever nigh.

Verse 3:
At morning, at noon, and at night
I ever will give Thee praise;
For Thou art my portion, O Lord,
And shall be though all my days!

Verse 4:
Through Him whom Thy Word hath foretold,
The Saviour and Morning Star,
Salvation and peace have been brought
To those who have strayed afar.
