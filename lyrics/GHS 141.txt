Verse 1:
I shall see the King
Where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day,
In the better land,
On the golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.

Chorus:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
â€™Twas on Calvary
Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.

Verse 2:
In the land of song,
In the glory-throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain
I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light. 

Verse 3:
I shall see the King,
All my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be
How He ransomed me
