Verse 1:
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Verse 2:
Before our Fatherâ€™s throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

Verse 3:
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathising tear.

Verse 4:
When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
