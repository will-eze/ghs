Verse 1:
GREAT God of wonders! all thy ways
Display the attributes divine;
But countless acts of pardoning grace
Beyond thine other wonders shine:
Who is a pardoning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?

Verse 2:
In wonder lost, with trembling joy
We take the pardon of our God;
Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,
A pardon bought with Jesus’s blood:
Who is a pardoning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?

Verse 3:
Pardon-from an offended God!
Pardon-from sin of deepest dye!
Pardon-bestowed through Jesus’s blood!
Pardon-that brings the rebel nigh!
Who is a pardoning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?

Verse 4:
may this strange, this matchless grace,
This God-like miracle of love,
Fill the wide earth with grateful praise,
As now it fills the choirs above!
Who is a pardoning God like thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
