Verse 1:
Marvelous message we bring
Glorious carol we sing
Wonderful word of the King
Jesus is coming again!..

Chorus
Coming again coming again
Maybe morning maybe noon
Maybe evening and maybe soon
Coming again coming again
Oh what a wonderful day it will be
Jesus is coming again!..

Verse 2:
Forest and flower exclaim
Mountain and meadow the same
All earth and heaven proclaim
Jesus is coming again!..

Verse 3:
Standing before Him at last
Trial and trouble all past
Crowns at His feet we will cast
Jesus is coming again!..
