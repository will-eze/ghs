Verse 1:
 Saviour from sin, I wait to prove
That Jesus is thy healing name,
To lose, when perfected in love,
Whate’er I have, or can, or am;
I stay me on thy faithful word,
The servant shall be as his Lord.

Verse 2:
. Answer that gracious end in me,
For which thy precious life was given,
Redeem from all iniquity,
Restore and make me meet for heaven;
Unless thou purge my every stain,
Thy suffering and my faith are vain.

Verse 3:
Didst thou not die that I might live
No longer to myself, but thee?
Might, body, soul, and spirit give
To him who gave himself for me?
Come then, my Master, and my God,
Take the dear purchase of thy blood.

Verse 4:
Thy own peculiar servant claim,
For thine own truth and mercy’s sake,
Hallow in me thy glorious name,
Me for thine own this moment take,
And change and throughly purify:
Thine only may I lie and dine.
