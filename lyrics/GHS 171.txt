Verse 1:
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Verse 2:
Let me at Thy throne of mercy,
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Verse 3:
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Verse 4:
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heavâ€™n but Thee?
