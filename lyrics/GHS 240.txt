Verse 1:
Jesus is the same forever as of old
So now today
All the host of hell endeavor vainly to construct his way
In his people's heart he reigneth
Finishes what he begins
Jesus still all power retaineth
Saves His people from their sins.
 
Verse 2:
Jesus is the same forever
Yes he heals the sick today
As of old so now he never
Turns one suffering child away
He can cure the wordy disease
For he understand our frame
Bore our grief and so release
All who dare their right to claim

Verse 3:
Jesus is the same forever
Still he says in the abide
From his love no power can sever
Those who in their lord confide
Sweetly from all care he frees us
Ours the comfort his the shame
Blessed savior, Precious Jesus
There's no music light thy name
