Verse 1:
He knows the bitter, weary way,
The endless striving day by day,
The souls that weep, the souls that pray;
My Father knows, my Father knows.

Verse 2:
He knows when faint and worn we sink,
How deep the pain, how near the brink,
Of dark despair we pause and shrink;
My Father knows, my Father knows.

Verse 3:
He knows how hard the fight has been,
The clouds that come our lives between,
The wounds the world has never seen;
My Father knows, my Father knows.

Verse 4:
He knows! O heart, take up thy cross,
And know earthâ€™s treasures are but dross,
And all will prove as gain, not loss;
My Father knows, my Father knows.
