Verse 1:
I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When throâ€™ wonderful grace by my Savior I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Chorus:
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Verse 2:
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray,
Let me watch as a winner of souls;
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,
When His praise like the sea-billow rolls. 

Verse 3:
Oh, what joy it will be when His face I behold,
Living gems at His feet to lay down;
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold,
Should there be any stars in my crown.
