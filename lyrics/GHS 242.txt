Verse 1:
A good High Priest is come,
supplying Aaron’s place,
and taking up his room,
dispensing life and grace;
the law by Aaron’s priesthood came,
but grace and truth by Jesus’ name.

Verse 2:
He once temptations knew
of every sort and kind,
that He might succor show
to every tempted mind;
in every point the Lamb was tried
like us, and then for us He died.

Verse 3:
He died, but lives again,
and by the throne He stands,
there shows how He was slain,
opening His pierced hands;
our Priest abides and pleads the cause
of us who have transgressed His laws.

Verse 4:
I other priests disclaim,
and laws and offerings too;
none but the bleeding Lamb
the mighty work can do;
He shall have all the praise: for He
has loved, and died, and lives for me.
