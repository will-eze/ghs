Verse 1:
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Chorus:
It is well . . . with my soul . . .
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Verse 2:
Though Satan should buffet, tho’ trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

Verse 3:
My sin – oh the bliss of this glorious thought –
My sin – not in part, but the whole –
Is nailed to His cross: and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

Verse 4:
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll;
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

Verse 5:
But Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal:
Oh, trump of the angel! oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! Blessed rest of my soul!
