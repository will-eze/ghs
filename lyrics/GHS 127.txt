Verse 1:
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and pow’r.

Verse 2:
Not the labour of my hand
Can fulfil Thy law’s demand;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save and Thou alone.

Verse 3:
Nothing in my hands I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked come to Thee for dress,
Helpless look to Thee for grace,
Foul I to the fountain fly,
Cleanse me, Saviour, or I die.

Verse 4:
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes are closed in death;
While I soar through tracks unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgement throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
