Verse 1:
Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us for ever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul !
On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me,
How the billows cease to roll.

Verse 2:
Bringing life, and health, and gladness,
All around this heav’nly Guest;
Banish’d unbelief and sadness,
Chang’d our weariness to rest.

Verse 3:
Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming on us from on high.

Verse 4:
What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see His face;
What a perfect habitation,
What a quiet resting-place.
