Verse 1:
”The Holy Spirit’s power
Ye need,” the Master said;
“So wait till conies the hour
When on you He is shed.”
So praise did all their souls employ,
As tarried they with fervent joy.

Verse 2:
And when ten cloys were passed
With one accord were they,
Heaven’s windows long closed fast,
Were opened on that day;
With rushing mighty wind and flame,
The promised Holy Spirit came.

Verse 3:
Their loosened tongues were filled
With strange and wondrous words;
Heaven’s life their hearts had thrilled,
God’s goodness they declared;
“And unto all,” th’ Apostle said,
“Is the like gift, since Christ has bled.”

Verse 4:
Come now, ye sons of men,
This message now receive,
The Holy Spirit’s given
To all who will believe;
Ye, too, may know His mighty power,
And speak with tongues this very hour.

Verse 5:
Then charity divine,
Your yearning hearts shall fill
T’wards those who now repine,
Held in sin’s bondage still;
For these your zeal shall never tire
To snatch them from th’ e’erlasting fire.
