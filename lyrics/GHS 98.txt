Verse 1:
Rise, ye children of salvation,
All who cleave to Christ the Head,
Wake, arise! O mighty nation,
Ere the foe on Zion tread.

Chorus:
Pour it forth … a mighty anthem,
Like the thun … ders of the sea …
Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
More than conquerors are we …
More than con … querors are we …
More than con … querors are we …
Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
More than conquerors are we.

Verse 2:
Saints and heroes long before us,
Firmly on this ground have stood,
See their banners waving o’er us,
Conquerors through Jesus’ blood.

Verse 3:
Deathless we are unfearing,
Life laid up with Christ in God,
In the morn of His appearing,
Floweth forth a glory flood.

Verse 4:
Soon we all shall stand before Him,
See and know our glorious Lord,
Soon in joy and light adore Him,
Each receiving his reward.
