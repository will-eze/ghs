Verse 1:
On the cross crucified,
In great sorrow he died,
The giver of life was he,
Yet my lord was despised and rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary

Chorus:
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely he bore our sorrows,
And by his stripes we are healed!

Verse 2:
Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate’s judgment hall,
Now suffering afford perfect healing for all,
This wonderful healer’s mine

Verse 3:
came the leper to Christ,
Saying surely i know,
That thou lord canst make me whole,
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said,” yes i will”,
And touched him and made him clean

Verse 4:
He has healed my sick soul,
Made me every whit whole,
And he’ll do the same for you; he’s the same yesterday and today and forever,
The healer of men today!
