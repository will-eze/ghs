Verse 1:
My God, is any hour so sweet
From blush of morn to evening star,
As that which calls me to Thy feet—
The hour of prayer?

Verse 2:
Blest is that tranquil hour of morn,
And blest that hour of solemn eve,
When, on the wings of prayer upborne,
The world I leave.

Verse 3:
For then a day-spring shines on me,
Brighter than morn’s ethereal glow;
And richer dews descend from Thee
Than earth can know.

Verse 4:
Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiv’n;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
With hopes of Heav’n.

Verse 5:
No words can tell what sweet relief
There for my every want I find,
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind.

Verse 6:
Hushed is each doubt, gone ev’ry fear;
My spirit seems in Heav’n to stay;
And e’en the penitential tear
Is wiped away.

Verse 7:
Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to Thee.
