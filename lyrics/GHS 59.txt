Verse 1:
In the harvest field now ripened
There’s a work for all to do;
Hark! the voice of God is calling
To the harvest calling you.

Chorus:
Little is much when God is in it,
Labor not for wealth or fame;
There’s a crown, and you can win it,
If you go in Jesus’ name.

Verse 2:
Does the place you’re called to labor
Seem too small and little known?
It is great if God is in it,
And He’ll not forget His own. 

Verse 3:
When the conflict here is ended
And our race on earth is run,
He will say, if we are faithful,
“Welcome home, My child, well done!”
