Verse 1:
I gave My life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might’st ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead
I gave My life for thee;
What hast thou given for Me?

Verse 2
I spent long years for thee
In weariness and woe,
That an eternity
Of joy thou mightest know.
I spent long years for thee;
Hast thou spent one for Me?

Verse 3
My Father’s home of light,
My rainbow-circled throne
I left, for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone.
I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?

Verse 4
I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell.
I suffered much for thee;
What canst thou bear for Me?

Verse 5
And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love.
Great gifts I brought to thee;
What hast thou brought to Me?

Verse 6
Oh, let thy life be given,
Thy years for Me be spent,
World-fetters all be riven,
And joy with suffering blent.
I gave Myself for thee;
Give thou thyself to Me.
