Verse 1:
Come sing the praise of Jesus
Sing His love with hearts aflame,
Sing his wondrous birth of Mary
when to save the world He came;
Tell the life he lived for others
and His mighty deeds proclaim
for Jesus Christ is King.

Chorus:
Praise and glory be to Jesus,
praise and glory be to Jesus,
praise and glory be to Jesus,
for Jesus Christ is king.

Verse 2:
When foes arose and slew Him,
He was victor in the fight;
Over death and hell He triumphed
In His resurrection-might;
He has raised our fallen manhood
And enthroned it in the height,
For Jesus Christ is King.

Verse 3:
There’s joy for all who serve Him,
More than human tongue can say;
There is pardon for the sinner,
And the night is turned to day;
There is healing for our sorrows,
There is music all the way,
For Jesus Christ is king.

Verse 4:
We witness to His beauty,
And we spread His love abroad;
And we cleave the hosts of darkness,
With the Spirit’s piercing sword;
We will lead the souls in prison
To the freedom of the Lord,
For Jesus Christ is king.

Verse 5:
To Jesus be the glory,
The dominion, and the praise;
He is Lord of all creation,
He is guide of all our ways;
And the world shall be His empire
In the fulness of the days
For Jesus Christ is king.
