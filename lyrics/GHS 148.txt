Verse 1:
No tears in heaven, no sorrows given.
All will be glory in that land;
There’ll be no sadness, all will be gladness,
When we shall join that happy band.

Chorus:
No tears, No tears, no tears up there,
Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
No tears, No tears, no tears up there,
No tears in heaven will be known.

Verse 2:
Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder,
Where we shall spend an endless day;
Therewith our Savior, we’ll be forever,
Where no more sorrow can dismay.

Verse 3:
Some morning yonder, we’ll cease to ponder
O’er things this life has brought to view;
All will be clearer, loved ones be dearer
In heav’n where all will be made new.
