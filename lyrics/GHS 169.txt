Verse 1:
What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear;
What a privilege to carry
Ev’rything to God in prayer.
Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear –
All because we do not carry
Ev’rything to God in prayer.

Verse 2:
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a Friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Verse 3:
Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge, –
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
