Verse 1:
There is vict’ry within my soul
For the Spirit with me abides,
Let the waves of temptation roll,
Jesus keeps me whate’er betides.

Chorus:
Victory, Victory, Vict’ry in my soul,
I have glorious victory
Since Jesus took control,
Victory, Victory, sweeping like a flood,
I have glorious victory thro’ Jesus’ blood.

Verse 2:
Tho’ the conflict be fierce and long,
Tho’ the tempter my heart assail,
In my weakness yet I am strong,
For with Jesus I’ll e’er prevail.

Verse 3:
I have victory over sin,
I have victory o’er grave;
Even death now has lost its sting,
Halleluyah I know I’m saved.
