Verse 1:
Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinner, will you let Him in?

Chorus:
Room for Jesus, King of Glory!
Hasten now, His Word obey.
Swing the heart’s door widely open;
Bid Him enter while you may.

Verse 2:
Room for pleasure, room for business;
But for Christ, the Crucified,
Not a place that He can enter,
In the heart for which He died? 

Verse 3:
Room and time now give to Jesus;
Soon will pass God’s day of grace –
Soon your heart left cold and silent,
And your Savior’s pleading cease.
