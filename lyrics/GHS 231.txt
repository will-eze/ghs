Send the light! Send the light!

Let it shine from shore to shore!
Send the light, and let its radiant beams,
Light the world forevermore!

And a golden off’ring at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

“Send the light! Send the light!”
And a Christ-like spirit everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

“Send the light! Send the light!”
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!
