Verse 1:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.

Chorus:
Rescue the perishing,
care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Verse 2:
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with th
em gently,
He will forgive if they only believe.

Verse 3:
Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.

Verse 4:
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it,
Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently win them,
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.
