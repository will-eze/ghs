Verse 1:
If I walk in the pathway of duty,
If I work till the close of the day;
I shall see the great King in His beauty
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

Chorus:
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way,
I will rest at the close of the day,
And I know there are joys that await me
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

Verse 2:
If for Christ I proclaim the glad story,
If I seek for His sheep gone astray;
I am sure He will show me His glory
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

Verse 3:
Here the dearest of ties we must sever,
Tears of sorrow are seen everyday;
But no sickness, no sighing forever
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

Verse 4:
And if here I have earnestly striven
And have tried all His will to obey;
’Twill enhance all the rapture of heaven
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.
