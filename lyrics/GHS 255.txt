Verse 1:
They were gathered in an upper chamber,
as commanded by the risen Lord,
and the promise of the Father
there they sought with one accord,
when the Holy Ghost from heaven
descended
like a rushing wind and tongues of fire:
so dear Lord, we seek Thy blessing,
come with glory now our hearts inspire.

Chorus:
Let the fire fall, let the fire fall,
let the fire from heaven fall;
we are waiting and expecting,
now in faith, dear Lord, we call;
let the fire fall, let the fire fall,
on Thy promise we depend;
from the glory of Thy presence
let the Pentecostal fire descend.

Verse 2:
As Elijah we would raise the altar
for our testimony clear and true,
Christ the Saviour, loving Healer,
coming Lord, Baptizer too,
ever flowing grace and full salvation,
for a ruined race Thy love has planned;
for this blessed revelation,
for Thy written word we dare to stand.

Verse 3:
‘This the covenanted promise given
to as many as the Lord shall call,
to the fathers and their children,
to Thy people, one and all;
so rejoicing in Thy word unfailing,
we draw nigh in faith Thy power to
know –
come, O come, Thou burning Spirit,
set our hearts with heavenly fire aglow.

Verse 4:
With a living coal from off Thy altar
touch our lips to swell Thy wondrous
praise,
to extol Thee, bless, adore Thee,
and our songs of worship raise;
let the cloud of glory now descending
fill our hearts with holy ecstasy,
come in all Thy glorious fullness,
blessed Holy Spirit, have Thy way
