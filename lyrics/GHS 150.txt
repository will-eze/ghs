Verse 1:
Lord, as of old at Pentecost
Thou didst Thy power display,
With cleansing, purifying flame,
Descend on us today.

Chorus:
Lord, send the old time power, the Pentecostal power!
Thy floodgates of blessing on us throw open wide!
Lord, send the old time power, the Pentecostal power,
That sinners be converted and Thy name glorified!

Verse 2:
For mighty works for Thee, prepare
And strengthen evâ€™ry heart;
Come, take possession of Thine own,
And nevermore depart. 

Verse 3:
All self consume, all sin destroy!
With earnest zeal endue
Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
O Lord, our faith renew! 

Verse 4:
Speak, Lord! before Thy throne we wait,
Thy promise we believe,
And will not let Thee go until
The blessing we receive.
