Verse 1:
Impatient heart, be still!
What tho’ He tarries long?
What tho’ the triumph song
Is still (is still) delayed?
Thou hast His promise sure,
And that is all secure;
Be not afraid,
Be not afraid!
Be still! be still!
Impatient heart be still!

Verse 2:
My eager heart, be still!
Thy Lord will surely come,
And take thee to His home,
With Him (with Him) to dwell;
It may not be today;
And yet, my soul, it may;
I cannot tell,
I cannot tell.
Be still! be still!
My eager heart be still!

Verse 3:
My anxious heart, be still!
Watch, work, and pray, and then
It will not matter when
Thy Lord (Thy Lord) shall come.
At midnight, or at noon;
He cannot come too soon
To take thee home,
To take thee home.
Be still! be still!
My anxious heart be still.
