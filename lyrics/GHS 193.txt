Verse 1:
Another year is dawning, A path unknown, untried,
‘Twould fill me with foreboding, had I no hand to guide;
But He who walked beside me, all through the yesteryear;
Whatever may betide me, has promised to be near;

Verse 2:
Another year with Jesus! Ah, then, no dread I know.
His love is ever precious, howe’er the winds may blow.
E’en when the storm is fiercest, in Him my soul may rest,
And find sweet peace and comfort upon his loving breast.

Verse 3:
Another year to trust Him, yes, I can trust Him still,
Who never yet has failed me, as I have sought His will.
His rod and staff He giveth, to be my strength and stay,
And tenderly He leadeth, along the homeward way.

Verse 4:
Another year to serve Him, to labour for Him here,
E’en while the shadows lengthen and night is drawing near.
I know not when He’ll call me to lay my sickle by-
Oh, may I then be faithful, while now the moments fly!

Verse 5:
Another year to love Him, whom I have loved so long;
Another year to praise Him in glad triumphant song.
Whate’er the future holdeth, of sorrow, toil, or pain;
His precious Love endureth forevermore the same.

Verse 6:
Another year with Jesus! I thank thee, Lord, today
For Thy unfailing presence along life’s rugged way.
Guide me, O blest redeemer, teach me to do Thy will,
And Thy own perfect purpose in me each day fulfil.
