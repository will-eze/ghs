Verse 1:
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He’ll prepare for us a place.

Chorus
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We’ll sing and shout the victory.

Verse 2:
While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will overspread the sky;
But when trav’ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Verse 3:
Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev’ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Verse 4:
Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we’ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.
