Verse 1:
God of all power, and truth, and grace,
which shall from age to age endure,
whose word, when heaven and earth shall pass,
remains and stands for ever sure;

Verse 2:
that I your mercy may proclaim,
that all the world your truth may see,
hallow your great and glorious name,
and perfect holiness in me.

Verse 3:
Purge me from every evil blot;
my idols all be cast aside:
cleanse me from every sinful thought,
from all the stain of self and pride.

Verse 4:
Give me a new, a perfect heart,
from sorrow free, and doubt and fear;
the mind which was in Christ impart,
and let my spirit know you near.

Verse 5:
O that I now, from sin released,
your word may to the utmost prove,
enter into the promised rest,
the Canaan of your perfect love!
