Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Verse 2:
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Verse 3:
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

Verse 4:
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Verse 5:
Take my will, and make it thine,
It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart, it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Verse 6:
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure-store;
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.
