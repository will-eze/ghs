Verse 1:
If you’ve found Jesus the Friend that you need,
If He is loving and true,
If you have found Him a Saviour indeed,
Somebody else needs Him, too…

Chorus:
Somebody somewhere perhaps at your side;
Someone is waiting for you;…
Say that for all Jesus suffered and died;
They-need Him., they need Him, too…

Verse 2:
If you are happy, and praise fills your heart,
Trust Him to carry you through;
If He His Spirit and love can impart,
Somebody else needs Him, too…

Verse 3:
If you have comfort in being God’s child,
If He is faithful to you,
Think, when you see those whom sin has defiled
Somebody else needs Him, too…

Verse 4:
When the Lord gives you His love and His care,
Something He gives you to do;
You have the gospel with others to share,
Somebody else needs Him, too…
