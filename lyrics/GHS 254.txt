Verse 1:
Lower and lower, dear Lord, at thy feet,
Seeking thy Spirit, thy mercy so sweet;
Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,
Lower and lower be Thou all in all.

Chorus:
Lower and lower, down at thy cross,
All the world’s treasure counting but dross;
Down at thy feet, blessed Saviour, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!

Verse 2:
Lower and lower, dear Saviour, we pray,
Losing the self-life still more every day;
Weak and unworthy, we’re looking above:
Empty us wholly; then fill us with love. 

Verse 3:
Lower and lower; yet higher we rise
Lifted in Jesus, led on to the skies;
Humbly we follow the way of the cross,
Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.
