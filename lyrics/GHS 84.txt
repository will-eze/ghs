Verse 1:
Deeper, deeper, in the love of Jesus,
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

Chorus:
O deep…er yet, I pray,…
And high…er everyday…
And wis…er, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy word.

Verse 2:
Deeper, deeper! blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
And His perfect will.

Verse 3:
Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Verse 4:
Deeper, higher everyday in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqu’ror, and in His own image
Perfected at last.
