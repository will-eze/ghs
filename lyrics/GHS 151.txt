Verse 1:
“There shall be showers of blessing:”
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus:
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.
Verse 2:
“There shall be showers of blessing:” –
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

Verse 3:
“There shall be showers of blessing:”
Send them upon us O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honour Thy Word.

Verse 4:
“There shall be showers of blessing”
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we’re confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call.

Verse 5:
“There shall be showers of blessing,”
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
If we let God have His way.
