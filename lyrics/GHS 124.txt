Verse 1:
Sinners Jesus will receive:
Sound this word of grace to all
Who the heav’nly pathway leave,
All who linger, all who fall.

Chorus:
Sing it o’er (Sing it o’er again)
and o’er again:(Sing it o’er again:)
Christ receiveth (Christ receiveth sinful men)
sinful men. (Christ receiveth sinful men)
Make the message (Make the message clear and plain)
clear and plain: (Make the message clear and plain)
Christ receiveth sinful men.

Verse 2:
Come, and He will give you rest;
Trust Him, for His word is plain;
He will take the sinfulest;
Christ receiveth sinful men. 

Verse 3:
Now my heart condemns me not,
Pure before the law I stand;
He who cleansed me from all spot
Satisfied its last demand. 

Verse 4:
Christ receiveth sinful men,
Even me with all my sin;
Purged from ev’ry spot and stain,
Heav’n with Him I enter in.
