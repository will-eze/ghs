Verse 1:
I’ve left the land of Egypt with its bondage drear,
I’ve crossed the mighty Red sea with my Lord so dear,
And now the songs of Beulah fill my heart with cheer,
For I’m living in Canaan land.

Chorus:
I’m living in Canaan, living in Canaan,
I am living in Canaan land;
The joy-bells are ringing, and with rapture I’m singing,
For I’m living in Canaan land.

Verse 2:
I wander not in desert or on burning sand,
But thru the smiling meadows of a better land;
For God is ever leading me by His right hand,
I am living in Canaan land. 

Verse 3:
My sustenance is not the food that once was mine,
On manna of the wilderness I can not dine,
I’m feeding on the honey and the milk and wine,
For I’m living in Canaan land. 

Verse 4:
I’m drinking of a fountain that cannot run dry,
Redeemed thru grace divine and purified am I,
I’m singing while the golden hours are passing by,
For I’m living in Canaan land.
