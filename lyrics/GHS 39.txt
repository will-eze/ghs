Verse 1:
Would you be free from your burden of sin?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.

Chorus:
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r
In the blood of the Lamb,
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

Verse 2:
Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide,
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.

Verse 3:
Would you be whiter. Much whiter than snow?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow,
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.

Verse 4:
Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.
