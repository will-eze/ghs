Verse 1:
Guide me, O Thou Great Jehovah!
Pilgrim thro’ this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold me by Thy pow’rful hand:
Bread of heaven! Bread of heaven!
Feed me now and ever more,
Feed me now and ever more.

Verse 2:
Open now Thou crystal Fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow:
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
Lead me all my journey through.
Strong Deliverer! Strong Deliverer!
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.

Verse 3:
If I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside:
Bear me through the swelling torrent,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
Songs of praises! Songs of praises!
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.

Verse 4:
Saviour, come! we long to see Thee,
Long to dwell with Thee above;
And to know in full communion,
All the sweetness of Thy love.
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Take Thy waiting people home,
Take Thy waiting people home.
