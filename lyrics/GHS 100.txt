Verse 1:
Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe;
We will never falter when He bids us go;
Tho’ His righteous purpose we may never know,
Yet we’ll follow all the way.

Forward! forward! ’tis the Lord’s command.
Forward! forward to the promised land;
Forward! forward! let the chorus ring;
We are sure to win with Christ our King!

Verse 2:
Satan’s fearful onslaughs cannot make us yield;
While we trust in Christ, our Buckler and our Shiled;
Pressing ever on – the Spirit’s sword we wield,
And we follow all the way 

Verse 2:
Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled;
From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
Christ, our mighty Captain, overcomes the world,
And we follow all the way. 

Verse 3:
Fierce the battle rages, but ’twill not be long,
Then triumphant shall we join the blessed throng,
Joyfully uniting in the victor’s song,
If we follow all the way.
