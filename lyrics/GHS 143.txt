Verse 1:
When I come to the end of the long, long road,
The shadows will flee away,
And I’ll stand in the glorious light of God,
Where dwelleth eternal day.

Chorus:
When I come to the end, the end of the road,
To the land of eternity,
When I come to the end of life’s long road,
The face of my Lord I’ll see.

Verse 2:
Looking back o’er the years that were hard and drear,
The hand of the Christ I’ll see;
While my heart will go forth with a song of praise,
Because of His love for me. 

Verse 3:
When I come to the end of the long, long road,
And trials will all be past,
I shall look in the face of my dearest Friend,
Safe home in His heav’n at last.
