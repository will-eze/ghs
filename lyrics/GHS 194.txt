Verse 1:
O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
most beautiful, most bright;
on thee the high and lowly
through ages joined in tune,
sing “Holy, holy, holy”
to the great God Triune.

Verse 2:
On thee, at the creation,
the light first had its birth;
on thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths of earth;
on thee, our Lord victorious,
the Spirit sent from heav’n;
and thus on thee, most glorious,
a triple light was giv’n.

Verse 3:
Today on weary nations
the heav’nly manna falls;
to holy convocations
the silver trumpet calls,
where gospel light is glowing
with pure and radiant beams,
and living water flowing
with soul refreshing streams.

Verse 4:
New graces ever gaining
from this our day of rest,
we reach the rest remaining
to spirits of the blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises,
to Father, and to Son;
the church her voice upraises
to thee, blest Three in One.
