Verse 1:
Oft in danger, oft in woe,
onward, Christians, onward go;
bear the toil, maintain the strife,
strengthened with the bread of life.

Verse 2:
Onward, Christians, onward go,
join the war, and face the foe;
will ye flee in danger’s hour?
Know ye not your Captain’s power?

Verse 3:
Let not sorrow dim your eye;
soon shall every tear be dry:
let not fears your course impede;
great your strength, if great your need.

Verse 4:
Let your drooping hearts be glad;
march in heavenly armour clad;
fight, nor think the battle long:
soon shall victory wake your song.

Verse 5:
Onward then in battle move;
more than conquerors ye shall prove:
though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go.
