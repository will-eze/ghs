Verse 1:
Send the gospel of salvation,
To a world of dying men,
Tell it out to ev’ry nation,
Till the Lord shall come again.

Chorus:
Go and tell them, go and tell them,
Jesus died for sinful men,
Go and tell them, go and tell them,
He is coming back again.

Verse 2:
’Tis the churches great commission,
‘Tis the Master’s last command,
Christ has died for every creature,
Tell it out in every land.

Verse 3:
Christ is gathering out a people,
To His name from every race,
Haste to give the invitation,
Ere shall end the day of grace.

Verse 4:
Give the gospel as a witness,
To a world of sinful men,
Till the Bride shall be completed,
And the Lord shall come again.
