Verse 1:
Ere you left your room this morning
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ, our Saviour,
Did you sue for loving favour,
As a shield today?

O how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So when life seems dark and dreary,
Donâ€™t forget to pray.

Verse 2:
When you met with great temptation
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?

Verse 3:
When your heart was filled with anger
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?

Verse 4:
When sore trials came upon you
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates today?
