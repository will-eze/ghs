Verse 1:
Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.

Chorus:
Mercy there was great and grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burden’d soul found liberty,
At Calvary.

Verse 2:
By God’s word at last my sin I learned,
Then I trembl’d at the law I’d spurn’d,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Verse 3:
Now I’ve given to Jesus everything;
Now I gladly own Him as my King;
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.

Verse 4:
Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!
