Verse 1:
“Take up thy cross and follow me,”
I heard my Master say;
“I gave My life to ransom thee,
Surrender your all today.”

Chorus:
Wherever He leads I’ll go,
Wherever He leads I’ll go,
I’ll follow my Christ, Who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I’ll go.

Verse 2:
He drew me closer to His side,
I sought His will to know,
And in that will I now abide,
Wherever He leads I’ll go.

Verse 3:
It may be through the shadows dim,
Or o’er the stormy sea,
I take my cross and follow Him,
Wherever He leadeth me.

Verse 4:
My heart, my life, my all I bring
To Christ Who loves me so;
He is my Master, Lord, and King,
Wherever He leads I’ll go.
