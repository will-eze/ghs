Verse 1:
Onward, Christian soldiers! marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus going on before;
Christ, the royal Master leads against the foe;
Forward into battle, see, His banners go!

Chorus:
Onward Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.

Verse 2:
Like a mighty army moves the Church of God;
Brothers we are treading where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, all one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Verse 3:
Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane;
But the Church of Jesus constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never ’gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise, which can never fail.

Verse 4:
Onward, then, ye people, join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honour, unto Christ the King;
This thro’ countless ages men and angels sing.
