Jesus Only will we see.

Jesus only, Jesus ever,
Jesus all in all we sing;

Filling all our hearts within.

All our sicknesses He bare;

All His members still may share.

Fill us with the Holy Ghost.

And for Jesus we are waiting,
Listening for the trumpet’s sound;
Then it will be us and Jesus,
Living ever with our God.
