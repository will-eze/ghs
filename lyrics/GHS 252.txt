All the darkness of the night has passed away,
It is morning in my heart;
I am living in the sunlight of the day,
It is morning in my heart.

Songs of gladness now I sing,
For since Jesus is my King
It is morning, it is morning in my heart.

It is morning in my heart;
And i know that life for me begins again,
It is morning in my heart.

It is morning in my heart;
Every duty in the light of love I see,
It is morning in my heart.

Joy has come to dwell with me forever,
It is morning in my heart;
i shall sing it when i reach the other shore,
It is morning in my heart.
