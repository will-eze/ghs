Verse 1:
I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
There’s no other way but this;
I shall ne’er get sight of the Gates of Light,
If the way of the cross I miss.

Chorus:
The way of the cross leads home,
The way of the cross leads home
It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
The way of the cross leads home.

Verse 2:
I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
The path that the Saviour trod,
If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
Where the soul is at home with God.

Verse 3:
Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
To walk in it never more;
For my Lord says “Come” and seek my home,
Where He waits at the open door.
