Verse 1:
Why do you wait, dear brother,
O why do you tarry so long?
Your Savior is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.

Chorus:
Why not, why not,
Why not come to Him now?
Why not, why not,
Why not come to Him now?

Verse 2:
What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There’s no one to save you but Jesus,
There’s no other way but His way. 

Verse 3:
Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
O why not accept His salvation
And throw off your burden of sin? 

Verse 4:
Why do your wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you,
There’s danger and death in delay.
