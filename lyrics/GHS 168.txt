Verse 1:
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

I need Thee, oh, I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee,
Oh, bless me now, my Saviour,
I come to Thee.

Verse 2:
I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

Verse 3:
I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil.

Verse 4:
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
