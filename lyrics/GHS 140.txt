Verse 1:
On the mountain of Zion beyond the blue sky,
Stands a city so wondrous and fair;
I expect to depart for that land, by and by,–
For I’m laying my treasure up there.

Chorus:
I am laying my treasure up there, up there,
In that beautiful city so fair;
When its glories unfold
I’ll have riches untold,
For I’m laying my treasure up there.

Verse 2:
There’s a mansion awaiting God’s people, I’m told,
Which the Savior has gone to prepare;
There the walls are of jasper, the streets are of gold,
I am laying my treasure up there. 

Verse 3:
All the love of my heart, and my soul, mind and strength,
And the work that with Jesus I share,
Are but some of the riches I’ll find there at length,–
For I’m laying my treasure up there. 

Verse 4:
So altho’ a poor pilgrim on earth I may roam,
Ever constant in watching and prayer,
Soon I’ll hear the glad summons to start for my home,
For I’m laying my treasure up there.
