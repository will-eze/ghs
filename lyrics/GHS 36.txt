Verse 1:
I am bought not with riches,
Neither silver nor gold;
But Christ hath redeemed me,
I am safe in His fold;
In the Book of His kingdom,
With its pages so fair,
Through Jesus my Saviour,
My name’s written there.

Chorus:
My name’s written there,
On the page white and fair;
In the Book of God’s kingdom,
My name’s written there.

Verse 2:
My sins, they were many,
Like the sands of the sea,
But the blood of my Saviour
Is sufficient for me;
For His promise is written,
In bright letters that glow,
“Though your sins be as scarlet,
I will make them like snow.” 

Verse 3:
Oh! that beautiful city,
With its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings,
In pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh
To despoil what is fair;
Where the angels are watching,
My name’s written there.
