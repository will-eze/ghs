Verse 1:
Search me, O God, and know my heart today;
Try me, O Lord, and know my thoughts I pray;
See if there be some wicked way in me,
Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.

Verse 2:
I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
Fulfil Thy Word, and make me pure within;
Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame,
Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.

Verse 3:
Lord, take my life, and make it wholly Thine;
Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
I now surrender – Lord, in me abide.

Verse 4:
O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;
Send a revival – start the work in me:
Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessing now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
