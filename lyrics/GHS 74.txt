Verse 1:
There came from the skies in the days long ago,
The Lord with a message of love;
The world know Him not; He was treated with scorn—
This wonderful gift from above.

Chorus:
They crown’d Him with thorns,
He was beaten with stripes,
He was smitten and nailed to the tree;
But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
The heart that was broken for me.

Verse 2:
He came to His own—to the ones that He lov’d—
The sheep that had wander’d astray;
They heard not His voice; but the friend of mankind
Was hated and driven away.

Verse 3:
The birds have their nest, and the foxes have holes,
But He had no place for His head;
A pallet of stone on the cold mountainside,
Was all that He had for His bed.

Verse 4:
I cannot reject such a Saviour as He;
Dishonor and wound Him again;
I’ll go to His feet and repent of my sin,
Be willing to suffer the pain.

Verse 5:
I’ll take up my cross, I will walk by His side,
For the pathway of duty I see;
I will follow my Lord and abide in His heart,
The heart that was broken for me.
