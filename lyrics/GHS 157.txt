Verse 1:
Have you wandered away from your Father’s care,
Heavy hearted and sad do you roam?
There’s a sweet gentle voice calling now to you–
Wand-ring child, wand’ring child, O come home.

Chorus:
Child, come home, child come home,
Wand’ring child, why longer roam?
‘Tis thy Father entreats–
Wand’ring child, O come home.
Child, come home, child come home,
Wand’ring child, why longer roam?
‘Tis thy Father entreats–
Wand’ring child, O come home.

Verse 2:
Is your frail bark adrift on life’s raging sea,
Are you tossed on its billows and foam?
There’s a safe harbor home, waiting now for you–
Wand-ring child, wand’ring child, O come home. 

Verse 3:
He is pleading today, heed His gentle voice,
As He bids you no longer to roam,
To that dear Father’s house haste without delay–
Wand-ring child, wand’ring child, O come home.
