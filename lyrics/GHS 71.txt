Verse 1:
There is One loved me so that for me He died,
He’s my dear, precious Savior so true;
On the cross for my sins He was crucified:
I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

Chorus:
I want to see Jesus, don’t you?
My Savior so faithful and true;
When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
O I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

Verse 2:
When I’m weary and faint He is always near,
With His joy He my strength doth renew;
And He comforts my heart, speaking words of cheer:
I want to see Jesus, don’t you? 

Verse 3:
Holy angels keep watch o’er me through the night,
And each morning He guards me anew;
In the smile of His love doth my soul delight:
I want to see Jesus, don’t you? 

Verse 4:
He is fairer than lily or rose to me,
And His blessings fall soft as the dew;
O my heart, how it longs His dear face to see:
I want to see Jesus, don’t you? 

Verse 5:
There’s a place for my soul that He doth prepare,
And its beauty by faith I can view;
First of all, when I enter that mansion fair,
I want to see Jesus, don’t you?
