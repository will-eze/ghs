Verse 1:
Jesus may come today,
Glad day! Glad day!
And I would see my Friend;
Dangers and troubles would end
If Jesus should come today.

Chorus:
Glad day! Glad day!
Is it the crowning day?
I’ll live for today, nor anxious be,
Jesus my Lord I soon shall see;
Glad day! Glad day!
Is it the crowning day?

Verse 2:
I may go home today,
Glad day! Glad day!
Seemeth I hear their song;
Hail to the radiant throng!
If I should go home today. 

Verse 3:
Why should I anxious be?
Glad day! Glad day!
Lights appear on the shore,
Storms will affright nevermore,
For He is “at hand” today. 

Verse 4:
Faithful I’ll be today,
Glad day! Glad day!
And I will freely tell
Why I should love Him so well,
For He is my all today.
