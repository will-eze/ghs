Verse 1:
From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat:
â€˜Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

Verse 2:
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads;
A place than all beside more sweet:
It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

Verse 3:
There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.

Verse 4:
There, there on eagle wings we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
While glory crowns the mercy seat.
