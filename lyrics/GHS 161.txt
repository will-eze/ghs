Verse 1:
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next his cross to bear?
Someone is ready, someone is waiting;
Who’ll be the next a crown to wear?

Chorus:
Who’ll be the next, who’ll be the next?
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus us now?
Follow Jesus now!

Verse 2:
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Come and bow at his precious feet;
Who’ll be the next to lay every burden
Down at the Father’s mercy seat?

Verse 3:
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next to praise his name?
Who’ll swell the chorus of free redemption,
Sing hallelujah, praise the Lamb?
