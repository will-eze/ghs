Verse 1:
I dream’d that the great judgment morning
Had dawn’d, and the trumpet had blown;
I dream’d that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne.
From the throne came a bright shining angel
And stood on the land and the sea,
And swore with his hand rais’d to heaven,
That time was no longer to be.

Chorus:
And O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They pray’d, but their pray’r was too late.

Verse 2:
The rich man was there, but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgment,
His debts were too heavy to pay.
The great man was there, but his greatness
When death came was left far behind;
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find. 

Verse 3:
The widow was there and the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes.
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
And the man who had sold them the drink,
With people who gave him the license–
Together in hell they did sink. 

Verse 4:
The moral man came to judgment,
But self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as moral men too.
The souls that had put off salvation–
“Not to-night; I’ll get saved by and by;
No time now to think of religion!”
At last they had found time to die.
