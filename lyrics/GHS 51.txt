Where the spirit from self been set free,

Where the land is bearing in abundance and grapes of eschol grow
Won’t you join the band, where the life is grand l, in that blessed Canaan land?

All his fullness as he takes control,

O what glory he brings to the soul,

Have you crossed the Jordan into Canaan,
Have u left the wilderness behind,
And received the spirit in his fullness?
If you haven’t then make up your mind,
