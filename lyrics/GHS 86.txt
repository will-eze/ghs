Verse 1:
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let me Thy glory see,
Draw my soul close to Thee,
Then speak in love to me—Nothing between.

Verse 2:
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let not earth’s din and noise
Stifle Thy still small voice;
In it let me rejoice—Nothing between.

Verse 3:
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Nothing of earthly care,
Nothing of tear or prayer,
No robe that self may wear—Nothing between.

Verse 4:
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Unbelief disappear,
Vanish each doubt and fear,
Fading when Thou art near—Nothing between.

Verse 5:
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Till Thine eternal light,
Rising on earth’s dark night,
Bursts on my open sight—Nothing between.
