Verse 1:
There is a Home eternal,
Beautiful and bright,
Where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimm’d by night;
White-rob’d angels are singing
Ever around the bright throne;
When, O when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

Chorus:
Home, Beautiful Home!
Brigh,t beautiful Home!
Home, home of our Saviour,
Bright, beautiful Home!

Verse 2:
Flow’rs are ever springing
In that Home so fair,
Thousands of children are singing
Praises to Jesus there;
How they swell the glad anthems
Ever around the bright throne;
When, O when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home? 

Verse 3:
Soon shall I join that anthem,
Far beyond the sky;
Christ became my ransom,
Why should I fear to die?
Soon my eyes shall behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, O then shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?
