Verse 1:
Tell the whole wide world of Jesus,
Bear the news from shore to shore;
Telling sinners of the Savior,
Let the light spread more and more.

Chorus:
Tell the world, the whole wide world,
Bear the news from shore to shore;
Tell the whole wide world of Jesus,
Praise His name forevermore!

Verse 2:
Send abroad the Gospel heralds,
Let them take the blessèd light;
Into every land of darkness,
Piercing through the shades of night. [Chorus:]

Verse 3:
Yes, we’ll send the joyful message,
Over mountain, over wave;
Telling everywhere of Jesus,
And His mighty power to save. [Chorus:]

Verse 4:
While we pray for other nations,
Send them help with willing hand,
Let us not forget the home fields,
Jesus for our native land! [Chorus:]
