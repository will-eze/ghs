Verse 1:
Many a soul in the battle of life
Trembles with fear at the din and the strife,
Bearing alone, amid trial and care,
Burdens and sorrows God bids you to share.

Chorus:
Do something for others,
Something for others today!
Duty demands it,
And Jesus commands it!
Do something for others today.

Verse 2:
Many in doubt or in fear of the way,
Mutely appeal for your guidance today;
On your demeanor the choice may depend—
Are you concerned for the stranger or friend? 

Verse 3:
Many, disheartened by cruel deceit,
Broken and worn by the pangs of defeat,
Doubting, despairingly, helplessly stand,
Waiting, perhaps, for your strengthening hand. 

Verse 4:
Many are turning away from the right
Into the maze of the shadows of night;
Go to them, speak to them, over them pray,
Help them, support them—do something today.
