Verse 1:
There’s no one like my Saviour,
No friend can be like Him;
My never failing sunshine
When earthly lights grow dim;
When summer flow’rs are blooming,
The brightness of my joy;
O, may His happy service
My heart and life employ!

Chorus:
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
No one, no, such a friend can be;
No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.

Verse 2:
There’s no one like my Saviour;
In seasons of distress
He draws me closer to Him,
To comfort and to bless;
He gives me in temptation
The strength of His right arm;
His angels camp around me
To keep me from all harm. 

Verse 3:
There’s no one like my Saviour;
He pardons all my sin,
And gives his Holy Spirit
A springing well within;
He leads me out to service
With gentle touch and mild;
O wonder of all wonders
That I should be His child! 

Verse 4:
There’s no one like my Saviour,
Come now, and find it true;
He gave His life a ransom,
His blood was shed for you;
Then when we reach the City
Of everlasting light,
We’ll sing with saints and angels,
All honour, pow’r and might.
