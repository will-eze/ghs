Verse 1:
Rejoice in the Lord! Oh, let His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeem’d by His blood why should we ever fear
Since Jesus is our “all in all”?

Chorus:
“If God be for us, if God be for us,
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who? Who? Who?
Who can be against us, against us?”

Verse 2:
Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
And He will be our strength and stay.

Verse 3:
Confide in His word – His promises so sure;
In Christ they are “yea and amen;”
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
’Tis written o’er and o’er again.

Verse 4:
Abide in the Lord; secure in His control,
’Tis life everlasting begun;
To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul-
It never, never can be done!
