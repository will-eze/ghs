Verse 1:
The church’s one foundation
is Jesus Christ, our Lord;
we are a new creation
by water and the Word.
From heav’n he came and taught us
what perfect love can be;
through life and death he sought us,
and rose to set us free.

Verse 2:
The church in ev’ry nation
is one through all the earth;
our charter of salvation,
one God, one faith, one birth;
one name together blessing,
one holy food we share,
to one hope ever pressing,
at one in work and prayer.

Verse 3:
Still, schisms, tribulation,
and hatred fuel our war;
we wait the consummation
of peace forevermore.
The saints their watch are keeping;
their cry goes up, “How long?”
And soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song.

Verse 4:
Yet we on earth have union
with God, the Three in One,
and mystic, sweet communion
with those whose rest is won.
Oh, happy ones and holy!
God, give us grace that we,
like them, the meek and lowly,
may live eternally.
