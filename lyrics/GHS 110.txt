Verse 1:
I will tell to all that God is love;
Verse 1:
For the world has never known
The great compassion of His heart
For the wayward and the lone.

Chorus:
Till the whole world knows,
Till the whole world knows,
I will shout and sing of Christ my King,
Till the whole world knows.

Verse 2:
I’ll tell of mercy’s boundless tide,
Like the waters of the sea,
That covers every sin of man;
’Tis salvation full and free.

Verse 3:
I’ll tell of grace that keeps the soul,
Of abiding peace within,
Of faith that overcomes the world,
With its tumult and its din.

Verse 4:
Eternal glory is the goal
That awaits the sons of light;
Eternal darkness, black as death,
For the children of the night.
