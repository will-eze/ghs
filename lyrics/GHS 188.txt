Verse 1:
O Lord, how happy should we be
If we could cast our care on Thee,
If we from self could rest,
And feel at heart that One above,
In perfect wisdom, perfect love,
Is working for the best!

Verse 2:
How far from this our daily life,
Ever disturbed by anxious strife,
By sudden, wild alarms!
O could, we but relinquish all
Our earthly props, and simply fall
On Thy almighty arms!

Verse 3:
Could we but kneel and cast our load,
E’en while we pray, upon our God,
Then rise with lightened cheer,
Sure that the Father, who is nigh
To still the famished raven’s cry,
Will hear in that we fear!

Verse 4:
Lord, make these faithless hearts of ours
Such lesson learns from birds and flowers;
Make them from self to cease,
Leave all things to a Father’s will,
And taste, before Him lying still,
E’en in affliction, peace.
